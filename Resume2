\cf0\i0 I was hired as a temp for the office whose responsibility was to help organize old data in the system. I had to search through their database and match cases in the system with any malpractice claims. I would have to match these using SSN numbers, and work addresses.\par
As time went on I was re-Trained to helping increase their quotas. I was trained to do the work of their full-time employees, and had to go through applications, and search to see if the information like SSN, malpractice insurance, and education certificates, and medical licenses were all in the files. \par
I had to leave after the two months due to school starting soon.\par
